## About The Project
Setting up a jenkins pipeline for testing and deploying python flask app




Certainly! Here's a modified GitHub project description that outlines a Jenkins CI pipeline for a Python Flask web app, including a push trigger to automate the pipeline:

Project Description: Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Python Flask Web App

Overview:
This GitHub repository houses a Python Flask web application with an integrated Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline automates testing, building, and image deployment to DockerHub while ensuring code quality through unit tests. Below are the key features and setup instructions:

Pipeline Steps:

Push Trigger: Any push to this repository's main branch triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
Testing: The pipeline runs unit tests on the Python Flask application to ensure code integrity and correctness.
Building: Upon successful testing, the code is built, packaged, and prepared for deployment.
Docker Image Creation: The application is containerized into a Docker image.
Docker Image Push: The Docker image is pushed to DockerHub, making it accessible for deployment in various environments.
Deployment: (Not included in this description) Depending on your use case, the Docker image can be automatically deployed to your desired environment.
Pipeline Configuration:

Jenkins is configured to listen for pushes to the main branch.
Jenkins is set up with the necessary plugins for Python, Docker, and GitHub integration.
Environment variables for DockerHub credentials are securely stored in Jenkins.
Jenkins pipelines are defined using a Jenkinsfile in the repository, ensuring version control and reproducibility.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository to your local development environment.
Make code changes, enhancements, or bug fixes.
Push your changes to the main branch.
Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline, validating and deploying your changes.
Requirements:

Python
Flask
Jenkins CI/CD Server
Docker
DockerHub Account
Note: This project is a basic template. Depending on your specific needs, you can extend the pipeline to include additional steps like integration tests, automated deployment to various environments, and more.

Feel free to fork this repository and adapt it to your own Python Flask web app project with Jenkins CI/CD automation. Happy coding and automating your development workflow!
